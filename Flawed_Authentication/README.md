# Flawed Authentication

## Difficulty Level
**Easy**

## Challenge Description
Your task is to gain unauthorized access to the system due to a **logic flaw** in the authentication mechanism.

### **Hints**
- Look at how the username is checked.
- You might not need the exact username "admin" to log in as admin.

## **Goal**
Find the correct username and password combination to access the **flag**.

## **Hints**
- Check how the username is validated. Is there a pattern that can be exploited?
- Check for common authentication bypass techniques. Example: SQL injection is not required, but simple logic flaws might exist.
