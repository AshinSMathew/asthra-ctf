# Steganography CTF Challenge

## Challenge Overview

Welcome to the Steganography Challenge! In this challenge, an image has been provided with a hidden message embedded within it. Your task is to extract the hidden message in order to retrieve the flag.

The challenge tests your ability to use steganography techniques to decode hidden information inside an image.

### Objective

- The challenge involves analyzing an image that contains a hidden message.
- You need to find and extract the secret message hidden inside the image.
- Once you find the message, it will contain a flag in the format: `asthra{your_flag_here}`.

### Difficulty Level

**Intermediate**

This challenge requires basic knowledge of steganography and the tools or techniques used to analyze and extract hidden data from images.

### Getting Started

1. **Download the image**: [link to image]
2. **Tools**: You may use any of the following tools:
   - `Steghide`, `zsteg`, `binwalk`, or similar steganography tools.
   - A text editor or hex editor to examine image metadata.

### Steps to Solve

1. **Analyze the image**: Inspect the image and its metadata. Check if any data has been hidden using common steganography methods.
2. **Extract hidden information**: Use relevant tools and techniques to extract the hidden message.
3. **Flag Format**: Once the message is decoded, the flag will be in the format: `asthra{your_flag_here}`.

### Hints

- Try using online steganography analysis tools.
- Look for patterns in the image, like unusual colors or pixel arrangements.
- Consider common steganographic techniques like LSB (Least Significant Bit) encoding.

### Flag Submission

Once you extract the flag, submit it on the CTF platform in the following format:
`asthra{your_flag_here}`

Good luck, and happy hunting!
